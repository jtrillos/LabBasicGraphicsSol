# Exercise 10: OpenGL and Scene Graphs

## Assignment 2: Camera, Mouse and Keyboard control

The ability to move freely in your scene comes from a camera object. This camera object controls the transformation matrix which maps your scene to the viewport and provides a consistent interface for your application. There is usually one camera in your scene. An arc-ball camera gives you the ability to rotate an object by click-and-drag on the screen (window). With the keyboard you can control the position and other parameters of your camera. For free movement in the plane you can use your keyboard arrow keys or w-a-s-d (for up-left-down-right arrow keys).
