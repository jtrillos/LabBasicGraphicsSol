# Exercise 10: OpenGL and Scene Graphs

## Assignment 3: Scene Graph

In this task you are going to implement a renderer that shows the eight planets, our moon and the sun of our solar system. 

## Bonus assignment 4: Ring system
Can you put a ring system on planets like Saturn? You can either model a disk yourself in programs
like Blender, export it as an OBJ file and load the mesh just like the one for the planets. Or you
can define the ring vertices and face indices yourself programatically. All it needs are two rings of
vertices sampled from circles of suitable radii and matching vertex-face indices to triangulate the area
in between.

**PD: This project is not complete.**
