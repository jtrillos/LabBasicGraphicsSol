# Exercise 11: Gradient Descent

## Assignment 1: Real function root finding - Newton Method

The Newton-Method1 uses a linear approximation of 𝑓 to iteratively guess the root of a function. Most functions are not only continuous but differential with a bounded 𝑓′′. For such methods the Newton- Method might be faster than the bisection method introduced on sheet 8.
