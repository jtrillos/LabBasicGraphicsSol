# Exercise 2: Basic Data types

## Assignment 2: Static Arrays

Arrays store multiple values of the same type. Here we use static arrays to store a fixed number of elements. For example int myArray[10] creates a variable myArray consisting of 10 integers. Any type (such as char, int, float, double, etc) is allowed.
