# Exercise 2: Basic Data types

## Assignment 3: Plain C-Strings

In plain C strings are stored as static arrays of char. The length is not stored explicit, instead they end with a character of value ’\0’ (they are null-terminated). Type char represents small numbers and characters alike. To get the number value of »a« in C is ’a’.

A string is created and initialized with char* msg = "Hello world";. The final ’∖0’ is automati- cally appended (char* will be introduced in following sheets and can be ignored).
