## Assignment 2: Dinamically Allocated Arrays

In that last sheet you did experiments using arrays. However, those arrays were of fixed size known at the compile time e.g. char array[10]. In case if you do not know the size of an array in advance, you will now learn how to dynamically allocate/deallocate arrays using the new/delete operator.
