# Exercise 4: Basic Classes

## Assignment 1: Structures

Structures allow to combine several variables into a logical entity. For example Vector3 (from the listing) combines 𝑥, 𝑦 and 𝑧 coordinates of a Vector in R3. Once defined structures can be used anywhere where basic types might be used (e.g. to create a variable or an array of structures). By convention we start structure names (and class names) uppercase contrary to variables that start lowercase.
