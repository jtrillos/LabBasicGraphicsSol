# Exercise 5: Basic Data Structures

## Assignment 1: Arrays

In this exercise you will implement a Array class representing a collection of elements. A user can append new elements to the array, has random access the element via an index, can clear the complete array or remove a single element. The implementation of the class hides memory managment (i.e. dynamic resizing of the data structure) from the user.
