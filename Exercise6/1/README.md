# Exercise 6: Data Structures with Pointers

## Assignment 1: Linked List

In that assignment you will get familiar with basic list data structures. Similar to arrays linked lists1 represent a sequence of data elements. But in contrast to arrays the elements are not stored sequential in memory, but are instead connected by pointers to the previous and next element (double linked list). For the first element _previous and for the last element _next is NULL.
