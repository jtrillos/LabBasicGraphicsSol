# Exercise 6: Data Structures with Pointers

## Assignment 2: Heap (with a Graph Structure)

Heaps3 are trees where each node is assigned a value and a nodes value is always smaller than the values of its child nodes. Those are specially useful for algorithms requiring repeatedly the smallest element of a set. We will implement a binary heap4, i.e. each node has at most 2 children. The following operations are defined:
