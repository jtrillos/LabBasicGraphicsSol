# Exercise 8: Basic Numerics

## Assignment 1: Floating point representation

In contrast to fix point numbers (e.g. integers), floating point numbers store a few significant digits (mantissa 𝑠) and the scale of the number using an exponent 𝑒. So a number is written as 𝑠 × 𝑏𝑒 and 𝑏 in the computer is often 2. While this representation does allow to represent numbers in a broad range, still a number of rounding errors may appear.
